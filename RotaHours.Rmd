## Background

All consultants are asked to record their on-call hours when first-on for ICU. These are used for job planning.


```{r environment}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


```{r file-imports}

# note the squiffy null value

df <- read_csv(here("data_raw/sept21_feb22.csv"), na=c("\\0"))
glimpse(df)

```


```{r}
summary(df)

df_trimmed <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    night1 = as_factor(night),
  ) %>% 
  select(rotadate, night1, time_night) %>% 
  mutate(n1 = fct_anon(night1))


# Anonymise the people who did nights by giving username a number.

df_anon <- df_trimmed %>% 
  select(-night1)

View(df_anon)
View(df_trimmed)

df_trimmed %>% group_by(night1) %>% 
  summarise(n())



```
